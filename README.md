Bioinformatics Project 
This is a files of python codes using a material I have learned in spring 2021 CS 22A. 
For test.py, it takes FASTA file and<br />
1: count each base in the sequence. <br />
2: print GC content percentage.<br />
3: make a dictionary of trinuecloetides in the sequence. <br />
For complement.py <br />
It takes string and returns complement sequence of a given string.
